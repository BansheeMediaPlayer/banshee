Sonance requires gst-sharp to be installed, along with the latest Mono
runtime, compiler, and libraries. Currently, gst-sharp is only available
via SVN.

Sonance MUST have:
  mono-1.1.4 or better
  gtk+-2.6 (or greater)
  gnome-vfs-2.0 / gnome-desktop-2.0
  gtk-sharp-2.0 (version 1.9.2+) ***
  gst-sharp (version 0.2.4+) ***
  sqlite 2.x
  
gtk-sharp-2.0 is a development release, but is relatively stable, and is
required by the latest gst-sharp. You can have both gtk-sharp and gtk-sharp-2.0
installed concurrently. 

It is recommended that you use mono-1.1.6 or greater. At least 1.1.4 is required.

Sonance uses the SQLite database library for underlying database transactions.
You must have this library installed (2.x series).

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Get mono-1.1.4 from the Mono project download page.
Get gtk-sharp-2.0 from the Gtk# project (gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net)

Mono 1.1.4:

	tar zxvf mono-1.1.4.tar.gz
	cd mono-1.1.4
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	su -c "make install"

Gtk# 2.0 (1.9.2)

	tar zxvf gtk-sharp-1.9.2.tar.gz
	cd gtk-sharp-1.9.2
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make
	su -c "make install"

gst-sharp (0.2.4 or greater)

	As of Sonance-0.3.0, a pre-compiled gst-sharp.dll assembly
	is bundled with Sonance. It is preferred that you build
	gst-sharp yourself, but if this is causing problems, you
	can try building Sonance with the bundled gst-sharp.dll.

	** BUILD gst-sharp FROM SVN (skip if using bundled) **

	svn co svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/gst-sharp
	cd gst-sharp
	./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
	make
	su -c "make install"

SONANCE:

	./configure --prefix=/usr

		** OR if you want the bundled gst-sharp **

	./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-bundled-gst-sharp
	
	make
	su -c "make install"
	

Also, you must have a working install of GStreamer (C libraries), and
it should be configured. Make sure you have run gst-register to register
your GStreamer plugins.

NOTE! 
Sonance is in very early development! I am not responsible if you run 
Sonance, and your computer catches fire. You have been warned.

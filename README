About
-----

Banshee is an audio management and playback application for the GNOME Desktop,
allowing users to import audio from CDs, search their library, create playlists
of selections of their library, sync music to/from iPods, and burn selections
to a CD.

Dependencies
-----------

	* The latest GNOME development packages (gtk+-2.6, gnome-vfs-2.0, etc)
	* A full Mono Development stack (mono 1.1.x, gtk-sharp-2.0, etc.)
	* sqlite 3
	* A working GStreamer (core, plugins, gconf)
	* libipoddevice (GNOME CVS), ipod-sharp (Mono SVN): this will require
	  HAL 0.5.2, which introduces a number of other low level dependencies
	  such as D-Bus, hotplug, and udev... basically bleeding edge GNOME 2.12.

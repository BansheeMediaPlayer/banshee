For Novell development, Banshee is under a three milestone development cycle.
At the end of this cycle, Banshee will be released as 1.0. As such, as of the
June 30 GNOME CVS commit, Banshee is labeled as version 0.7.x to match the
Milestone 1 release.

Milestone 1:    0.7.x
Milestone 2:    0.8.x
Milestone 3:    0.9.x
Public Release: 1.0.x

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Banshee MUST have

	* The latest GNOME development packages (gtk+-2.6, gnome-vfs-2.0, etc)
	* A full Mono Development stack (mono 1.1.x, gtk-sharp-2.0, etc.)
	* sqlite 2.x
	* A working GStreamer (gst-sharp.dll is provided for now)
	* libipoddevice (GNOME CVS), ipod-sharp (Mono SVN): this will require
	  HAL 0.5.2, which introduces a number of other low level dependencies
	  such as D-Bus, hotplug, and udev... basically bleeding edge GNOME 2.12.

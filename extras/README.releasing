To make a release:

Pre-release:
* If it's a stable release, check this first:
https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Banshee/StableReleasesPolicy
* Update src/Core/Banshee.Core/Resources/contributors.xml (manually)
* Update AUTHORS (cd extras/ && ./create-authors > ../AUTHORS)
* Update NEWS
* Check version in configure.ac (don't forget the display version)
* Update banshee.doap, build/windows/Installer*
* Run `make distcheck`
* Commit everything

Release:
* Run the `extras/make-release` script (from extras/ directory)
  specifying your gnome username with the env var GNOME_FTP_USER.
  + Note that this makes the tag, adds the version to bugzilla,
    and uploads the tarballs. You need to ssh to master.gnome.org to
    install the tarballs on ftp.gnome.org.

Post-release:
* In the master.gnome.org session, do:
  `cp release-data/banshee-<full_version>.news /ftp/pub/gnome/sources/banshee/<two_digit_version>/ && signal-ftp-sync`
* Update the website (http://banshee.fm/wp-admin/)
  + Add download/archives/$version page
    - Use `cd extras && ./create-release-notes > foo` script
      + By hand modify 'the previous major release notes...' section
    - Set sort order (negative file of full version, i.e.: -290), parent (Archives), and permalink (i.e.: http://banshee.fm/download/archives/2-9-0/)
  + Update Downloads/Archives page, adding entry for this release
  + Add a new blog post, uncategorized, tag 'news'
* For stable releases, ssh banshee@banshee.fm, update web/download.banshee.fm/release-info/banshee
  + This is used by the website to know what the latest release is
* Send announce e-mail
  + To: banshee-list@gnome.org, gnome-announce-list@gnome.org, mono-announce-list@lists.ximian.com
* Bump version in configure.ac (don't forget the display version) and commit.

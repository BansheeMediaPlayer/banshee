    and powerful interface and wide array of innovative features. Create

OTHER NOTES
===============================================================================

    These changes were made to ensure that you can run older Banshee releases
    in parallel with new Banshee releases:

    * The location of the user configuration directory for Banshee 1.x changed
      from ~/.config/banshee to ~/.config/banshee-1 (where ~/.config is defined
      by XDG policy)

    * The base GConf path used for storing settings via the GNOME backend
      changed from /apps/banshee to /apps/banshee-1; an XML configuration file
      will be used if the GNOME backend extension is not installed

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be 
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the 
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the 
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

MODULE NOTES
===============================================================================

 * Mono.Zeroconf (0.7.2) is now required by the DAAP plugin; avahi/mdns are not
   at compile time, though at least one is required at runtime.

 * Podsleuth (0.6.1) and ipod-sharp (0.8.0) are required for iPod support.

 * The location of the user configuration directory for Banshee changed from
   ~/.gnome2/banshee to and XDG based directory, typically ~/.config/banshee

 * The banshee-official-plugins module has been merged with core, so 
   banshee-official-plugins is now obsolete

 * Helix support has been removed from core and is now available from
   the Helix Banshee community project. More information regarding Helix
   support can be found at: http://helix-banshee.helixcommunity.org

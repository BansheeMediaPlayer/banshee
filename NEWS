NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.5.4 brings many big changes, new features, and fixes!

    New Features:

      * Opt-In Usage Data Collection

          Under Preferences, you can choose to "Improve Banshee by sending
          anonymous usage data" back to the Banshee developers.  This collects
          information on what version you're running, what OS, library size,
          slow SQL queries, and a whitelisted subset of your preferences. This
          information will help us choose better defaults and see what parts of
          Banshee are used most and can be improved.

      * Default Equalizer Presets

          Banshee now ships with several equalizer presets.

      * Banshee Community Extensions

          A new sub-project named Banshee Community Extensions has been
          created.  Its code is hosted on Gitorious, and its bugs tracked
          in bugzilla.gnome.org.  It already contains 9 extensions, including
          AlarmClock, Lyrics, and Mirage, and has 15 maintainers.  Its releases
          track Banshee's; for more information, see

            http://banshee-project.org/download/extensions/

      * Extensible Shuffle Modes

          Extensions can now add new shuffle modes and PlayQueue fill-by
          modes.  The Mirage extension is the first to take advantage of this,
          adding a Shuffle/Fill-by Similar mode based on acoustical analysis.

    Enhancements:

      * Wikipedia context pane extension enabled by default
      * Add tooltip to playback error column
      * On close Internet Archive item, return to Search
      * Notify user if try to sync missing file to DAP
      * Popup explanation of manual playlist ordering when appropriate
      * Simplify the default set of columns in Podcasts
      * Enable 'Delete From Drive' action in File System Queue
      * Make debuggable from within MonoDevelop
      * Coverart for unicode artist/albums now supported
      * Dropped glade-sharp dep; GNOME 3.0 ready

    Notable bug fixes:

      * Fixes to GIO backend
      * Many crash/startup fixes for OS X build
      * Enable LibraryWatcher only for Music and Video libraries
      * Do better job preserving IsCompilation metadata
      * Store some PlayQueue settings in the db (not GConf)
      * Fix several memory leaks

      * 40 bugs were fixed since 1.5.3

===============================================================================
DEPENDENCIES
===============================================================================

    * Mono 1.9.1 (.NET 2.0 Profile / gmcs)
    * SQlite 3.4
    * Gtk# 2.12
    * GStreamer 0.10.12

    * NDesk DBus (ndesk-dbus) 0.5
    * NDesk DBus GLib (ndesk-dbus-glib) 0.3
    * Mono.Addins (mono-addins) 0.3.1
    * TagLib# (taglib-sharp) >= 2.0.3.2

    * Required to build default feature stack:
      * libmtp >= 0.2.0
        * Note to packagers: since libmtp has different .so files for
          different versions, you need to require in your package the same
          version of libmtp you used to build Banshee.
      * ipod-sharp >= 0.8.5
      * mono-zeroconf >= 0.8.0
      * boo >= 0.8.1
      * GIO support requires glib >= 2.22, gio-sharp and gtk-sharp-beans
      * Library Watcher extension requires Mono >= 2.4.3
      * Accessibilty for ListView and Rating widgets requires Gtk# >= 2.12.10

    * Run-time requirements for default feature stack:
      * PodSleuth >= 0.6.6
      * Brasero >= 0.8.1
      * Avahi
      * gst-plugins-bad (providing the bpmdetect GStreamer plugin)

    Packagers:
      * --with-vendor-build-id=<foo> should always be set and detail the distro
        name and version (e.g. openSUSE 11.1), and the repository origin, such
        as 'Banshee Team PPA'; for example, the %distribution macro is used in
        the openSUSE Build Service, which expands to something like this:
        'home:gabrielburt:branches:Banshee / openSUSE_Factory'; also the
        build/configure time is stored along with the host OS and CPU

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

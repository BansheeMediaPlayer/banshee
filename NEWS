NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.3.3 is the fourth release in the new development series leading
    up to a future 1.4.0 stable release.

    Notable new features:

      * First preview of Mac OS X support (Eoin Hennessy, Aaron Bockover)
        - Currently very unstable due to GStreamer and GTK+ Quartz
        - Technology Preview only, there are many known issues
        - Please file bugs

    Notable bug fixes:

      * Removed the default application support for GNOME since many issues
        need to be ironed out here, and much of this belongs as integration
        inside of Linux distributions; it will be added back in a better
        state when GIO support lands in the GNOME backend (Gabriel Burt)

      * Rely more heavily on intltool and almost completely remove gettext;
        this mainly facilitates the OS X build environment (Aaron Bockover)

      * Updated the bundled equalizer to avoid a bad crash (BGO #557260, 
        Sebastian Dröge)

      * Rendering and integration fixes for OS X (BGO #557190, Eoin Hennessy)

      * Fix a bug with the play queue stopping after every song (BGO #557386,
        Gabriel Burt)

      * Allow both prepending and appending to the play queue; helpful for
        external applications wishing to integrate with Banshee's playback,
        like GNOME Do (BGO #557526, Alex Launi)

      * Support localization when running uninstalled (BGO #393046, 
        Bertrand Lorentz)

      * 5 bugs were FIXED since 1.3.2

DEPENDENCIES
===============================================================================

    * Mono 1.2.6 (.NET 2.0 Profile / gmcs)

    * Required to build default feature stack:
      * libmtp >= 0.2.0 and < 0.3.0 (0.2.6 recommended)
        * Note to packagers: since libmtp has different .so files for
          different versions, you need to require in your package the same
          version of libmtp you used to build Banshee.

      * PodSleuth (0.6.3)
      * Brasero   (0.8.1)
      * Avahi

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be 
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the 
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the 
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

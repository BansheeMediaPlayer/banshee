Banshee 2.9.1 - 2014-03-18
===============================================================================

    Banshee 2.9.1 is the culmination of five months' work by 17 developers,
    21 translators and dozens of bug reporters and testers. It is a development
    release, the second of the 2.9.x releases leading up to our future stable
    release Banshee 3.0.

    New Features:

      * GStreamer 1.x compatibility

            This is the first official upstream release compatible with versions of
            GStreamer 1.0 or newer.

      * Production-ready GStreamerSharp playback-engine backend, now default

            Our managed backend (that already allowed us to have playback working
            in the Windows platform) has been migrated to work with the revamped
            GStreamerSharp bindings (GObject-Introspection based, and capable of
            binding GStreamer 1.0 or newer) and is now the default one for all
            platforms.

            This paves the way to finish the long-standing goal of completely
            removing lower-level languages like C from our codebase, to lower
            the barrier of entry to new contributors, reduce complexity and
            increase stability.

            You can still use the optional unmanaged GStreamer backend, but
            before doing so we encourage you to provide us any feedback that
            you may have about the managed one (reporting bugs or writing to
            our forums or mailing lists), because we will deprecate this one
            very soon.

      * New "MediaPanel" UI, formerly called "MeeGo MediaPanel"

            The MeeGo specific UI has been now been renamed to MediaPanel and
            you can use it in your desktop environment now, just by clicking
            in the Media Panel option under the View menu (this extension is
            now enabled by default).


    Enhancements:

      * Notifications: use notify-sharp-3.0 in the system if available
      * bgo#690010: enable tests by default if NUnit dependency is found
      * WebBrowser: drop dependency on 'libsoup-gnome', which was deprecated
      * Video: default smart playlists are now invisible when empty, like Music ones

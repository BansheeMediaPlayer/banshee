The Banshee 0.10.11 release is mostly a fixes-only release. A small critical
feature was backported from 0.11.x/HEAD that allows files to be enqueued
in an already running instance (e.g. launching a file from Nautilus with
Banshee already running should play the file in the already running Banshee).

CHANGES SINCE 0.10.10
---------------------

  * Added D-Bus/Remote support for enqueueing files on an already 
    running instance

  * Added branding plugin support (in SLED, it's called "Helix (TM) Banshee")

  * Calculate the total duration of selected media for CD burning; ensure
    inserted media is large enough to hold it; media is checked before
	transcoding now (BNC #151332)

  * Added awareness for id3v2mux; set GST_PLUGIN_PATH to 
    $(libdir)/banshee/gstreamer-0.10 in case distros need to ship private
    GStreamer plugins (SLED)

  * Much improved CD burning (show error dialog with list of files that
    cannot be transcoded, fixed MP3/Data CD support, check for enough
    available disk space to perform transcoding)

  * Removed the File System Monitoring plugin from tree; was broken and
    deprecated for many months; will be replaced in 0.11.x with a 
	feature-complete Beagle plugin

  * Set volume calls now take effect on all engines, not just the 
    active engine (BNC #176255)

  * Call dbus_g_thread_init after Gtk.Application.Init to fix a crash
    seen on SMP machines (BNC #175378)

  * Ensure column ordering persists across instances (BNC #120666)

  * Added ViewOrder column to PlaylistEntries table (BNC #168653)

  * Use g_filename_to_uri to do proper filename->URI conversions (BNC #147144)

  * Reset vertical scroll adjustment of playlist view so tracks don't
    seemingly disappear under some circumstances (BNC #174406)

  * Make 'return' default dialog action key for HIG message 
    dialogs (BNC #172450, Robert Vojta)

  * Fixed import/copy bug regarding library path (BNC #171101, Robert Vojta)

  * Properly load files in shallow directories (BNC #163911, Simon Brys)

  * Added application/x-vorbis+ogg and application/x-vorbis+ogg (BNC #169616)

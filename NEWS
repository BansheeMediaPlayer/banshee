Banshee 0.10.10 is now out! This release marks the stabilization of
the 0.10.x series. 0.10.x releases will be made from the
BANSHEE_0_10_9_SL branch in CVS.

As such, no new features will be introduced in the 0.10.x series, 
but lots of great work will soon be going into HEAD in preparation 
for the first 0.11.x release. For more information on what is soon 
to come in the 0.11.x series, read the Banshee Roadmap 
(work in progress):

NOTES
-----

[1] NJB support requires a few things that are distribution specific and may
not be available yet. First, the distribution must support making the NJB
device (through libusb) accessible to users (done by matching against 
portable_audio_player.type). This should be done through HAL resmgr 
with the following entry into an FDI file in fdi/policy/10osvendor:

<deviceinfo version="0.2">
<device>
  ...
  <match key="info.category" string="portable_audio_player">
    <match key="portable_audio_player.access_method" string="user">
      <merge key="resmgr.class" type="string">audioplayer</merge>
    </match>
  </match>
  ...
</device>
</deviceinfo>

Additionally, the 20-njb.fdi file must be installed in
fdi/information/20thirdparty/

The 20-njb.fdi file can be found here:
http://banshee-project.org/files/misc/20-njb.fdi

To verify that HAL is properly setting permissions on the device, 
run "njb-handshake"

Banshee also requires njb-sharp 0.3.0 now.

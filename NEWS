Banshee 0.11.1

"Import, organize, play, and share your music using Banshee's simple, 
powerful interface. Rip CDs, play and sync your iPod, create playlists, 
and burn audio CDs. Most portable music devices are supported. Banshee 
also has support for podcasting, smart playlists, music recommendations, 
and much more."


MODULE NOTES
------------

 * Banshee is now made up of the core module, banshee, and the official 
   plugins module, banshee-official-plugins

 * banshee-official-plugins is recommended, but not required to run Banshee

 * libipoddevice (0.5.1) and ipod-sharp (0.6.2) are required for iPod support

 * helix-dbus-server (0.3.0) is required for Helix/RealPlayer integration
 

NEW CORE FEATURES
-----------------

 * New encoding profile support: user friendly and easily configurable. 
   Vorbis uses the quality metric instead of constant bitrates. Each
   DAP device can also save and manage its own encoding profile. 
   (Aaron Bockover)

 * Updated DAAP core to 0.3.5; importing from DAAP now works 
   (daap-sharp, James Willcox)

 * New DBus support that does not depend on old dbus-sharp or libdbus; see
   http://ndesk.org/DBusSharp (Alp Toker, Aaron Bockover)

 * HAL support now uses DBus instead of libhal (Aaron Bockover)

 * Notification support now uses DBus instead of libnotify (Sebastian Dr√∂ge)

 * Updates to smart playlists (Gabriel Burt)

 * Updated build system - easier to build banshee components and supports
   running fully uninstalled ('make run') (Aaron Bockover)

 * Patches merged back from 0.10.x: BNC #200953, #199902, #188437

 * Other bugs fixed: BNC #184491, #187643, #199345, BGO #357548, #356990,

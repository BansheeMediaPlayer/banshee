OTHER NOTES
===============================================================================

    These changes were made to ensure that you can run older Banshee releases
    in parallel with new Banshee releases:

    * The location of the user configuration directory for Banshee 1.x changed
      from ~/.config/banshee to ~/.config/banshee-1 (where ~/.config is defined
      by XDG policy)

    * The base GConf path used for storing settings via the GNOME backend
      changed from /apps/banshee to /apps/banshee-1; an XML configuration file
      will be used if the GNOME backend extension is not installed

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be

    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the 
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.0 is the culmination of many months of hard work by dozens of
    people.  This release cycle has seen Banshee support video, and add the
    long-requested artist/album browser and play queue.

    Banshee now uses much less memory and has greatly improved startup speed.
    It can handle collections that are much larger in size without adversely
    affecting application speed or memory usage.

    These core architectural changes also allowed us to cleanly implement
    many great new features and provides a framework for new features to
    be easily developed in the future.

    Features in this release include:

      * Artist/Album Browser
      * Play Queue
      * Powerful new query/search capabilities

      * Audio CD playback and ripping
      * Mass Storage Digital Audio Player support

      * Extension Manager

      * Podcast Support
      * Automatic CD Importing
      * CD Burning
      * New Device Storage Indicator
      * Automatically Grabs all Cover Art

    Other features, bug fixes, and errata:

      * Play Count, Skip Count, Last Played, and Last Skipped all now kept up to date
      * Allow editing of artist and album names

      * Improved gstreamer error handling (for missing files, codecs, etc)
      * Shuffle and repeat are automatically disabled while playing Last.fm
      * Columns specific to type of source (Music, Video, Podcast)
      * Add File Size column, right-align it and Duration

      * Filter for podcasts to only show new items

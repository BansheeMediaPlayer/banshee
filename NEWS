===============================================================================
MAJOR FEATURE/FIXES/PERFORMANCE UPDATES
===============================================================================

Cool New Features
-----------------

 * Much improved sorting! Sorting by track number now properly sorts first 
   by artist, album, then track number. Sort settings are done now at the 
   source level, not the global level, so different sorts can be applied 
   on different sources independently. Sort settings are also saved (persist 
   across instances) for the library and playlists. Nat Friedman is "a man of 
   few wants." (Aaron Bockover)

 * Search works similarly now - each source can have its own filter. 
   No longer is it shared between all sources. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Set preferred library structure in preferences dialog, which allows 
   for the selection of folder and filename patterns. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Initial support for Rio Karma DAP devices. (Experimental, Bob Copeland)

 * Do not stop playback on an error or report error in a dialog. Disable 
   the problematic track instead and continue playing. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Added a "Close" (CTRL+W) option above "Quit". Close hides to 
   the tray. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Show a lock icon on password protected DAAP sources. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Improved DAAP connection status and error reporting UI. (Aaron Bockover)

 * A confirmation dialog will now be presented when a playlist is to be 
   deleted to help prevent accidental data loss. It has a "do not ask me 
   again" check box if you find such a prompt annoying. (Aaron Bockover)

 * It is now possible to copy songs directly from Banshee to Nautilus using 
   the edit+copy menu item, accelerator, or context menu item. This has always 
   been possible with drag and drop, but some prefer CTRL+C. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Updated artwork: two excellent new icons for static and smart playlists, 
   a perfected 32px application icon, and a new splash screen. (Jakub Steiner)

 * Error correction option (paranoia mode) for CD importing. 
   (Christopher James Halse Rogers)

 * The audio output sync is now configured for the "Music and 
   Movies" profile. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Added a --no-source-change command line argument that will prevent 
   the active source from changing when Banshee is launched with --dap or 
   --audio-cd and an instance was already running. Add --no-source-change 
   to your GNOME Volume Manager Banshee commands if you don't agree with our 
   default behavior of changing sources when a device or disc becomes present 
   in the system. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Improved podcasting support, including certificate support (Nathan Palmer,
   Mike Urbanski). Better support for enclosures, lots of minor UI polish.
   (Mike Urbanski, Aaron Bockover) [Banshee Official Plugins]

 * UI improvements to Mini Mode plugin (Michael Monreal) 
   [Banshee Official Plugins]

The Most Important Bad-Bug Fixes
--------------------------------

 * Lots of fixes regarding iPod detection, mass storage syncing, and managed 
   DBus/HAL. This should solve all the issues in previous releases regarding 
   iPod detection. It requires HAL volumes for the iPod to have a
   volume.fsusage=filesystem property. If this is not the case, it's a 
   distro issue. (Aaron Bockover, Alp Toker, Gabriel Burt, David Zeuthen)

 * Locale/culture fixes regarding number formatting when parsing audio profile
   pipelines. Fixed bitrate issue with faac profile. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Fix some crashes coming from the podcast plugin (Mike Urbanski)

Performance Improvements
------------------------

 * Newly-imported tracks handled in batches, greatly improving import time; 
   many very large optimizations in taglib-sharp that also improve import 
   time. Import time has gone down from 10 minutes to almost 2.5 minutes 
   on a T60p with a 5200 song library. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Massive performance improvement regarding switching sources. Time is 
   down from 1 minute to under 1 second in some extreme cases. (Gabriel Burt)

 * Assembly reflection performance improvements. (saves memory, small 
   amount of startup time - Aaron Bockover)

 * Lots of good performance and functionality improvements to smart 
   playlists. (Gabriel Burt)

----------------

   New translations for this release:

     * Arabic (Khaled Hosny)

   Updated translations for this release:
 
    * Catalan (Jordi Mas)
    * Czech (Jakub Friedl) 
    * Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela)
    * Hungarian (Gabor Kelemen)
    * Lithuanian (Žygimantas Beručka)
    * Norwegian bokmål (Kjartan Maraas)
    * Russian (Alexandre Prokoudine)
    * Swedish (Daniel Nylander)
    * Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

For all the Awesome Banshee Developers
--------------------------------------

 * Boo scripting support; scripts can provide a static entry point or use 
   the standard Banshee plugin API, but no compilation is necessary. Scripts 
   must be placed in in ~/.gnome2/banshee/scripts. (Aaron Bockover)

 * Lots of work on the Boo shell integration for live debugging and testing.
   Reflection-based live debugging was started, lots to add here. 
   (Aaron Bockover)

 * New icon-theme-installer script that can be used from within make 
   to properly install lots of icons into the theme and also update the 
   icon cache. See build/icon-theme-installer for details (other project 
   developers may like this!) (Aaron Bockover)

 * Run uninstalled with full plugin and DAP support. "make run" from the 
   top source directory (seriously, just build and run - no installation is 
   necessary) (Aaron Bockover)

 * Much much much cleaner configure.ac. Lots of isolated and reusable 
   macros replacing spaghetti autoconf+bash. Generic detection and 
   configuration done through reusable Shamrock [1] m4 macros. For instance, 
   this is as hard as it gets to setup an autotools environment for 
   Mono with Shamrock:

      dnl Mono and gmcs
      SHAMROCK_CHECK_MONO_MODULE(1.1.10)
      SHAMROCK_FIND_MONO_2_0_COMPILER
      SHAMROCK_FIND_MONO_RUNTIME
      SHAMROCK_CHECK_MONO_2_0_GAC_ASSEMBLIES([
          System.Data
          System.Web
          System.Web.Services
          Mono.Cairo
          Mono.Data.SqliteClient
          Mono.Posix
      ])

   [1] Shamrock is a set of m4 macros for properly doing common and useful
       stuff in a configure.ac. It's focused on making Mono+autotools 
       integration easy, and is part of the Banshee project. Feel free to 
       use the macros in any project. See build/m4/shamrock. (Aaron Bockover)

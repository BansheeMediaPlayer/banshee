===============================================================================
DEPENDENCIES
===============================================================================

    * Mono 1.2.6 (.NET 2.0 Profile / gmcs)
    * SQlite 3.4
    * Gtk# 2.10
    * GStreamer 0.10.3

    * NDesk DBus (ndesk-dbus) 0.5
    * NDesk DBus GLib (ndesk-dbus-glib) 0.3
    * Mono.Addins (mono-addins) 0.3.1
    * TagLib# (taglib-sharp) 2.0.3.1

    * Required to build default feature stack:
      * libmtp >= 0.2.0 
        * Note to packagers: since libmtp has different .so files for
          different versions, you need to require in your package the same
          version of libmtp you used to build Banshee.
      * ipod-sharp >= 0.8.1
      * mono-zeroconf >= 0.8.0
      * boo >= 0.8.1

    * Run-time requirements for default feature stack:
      * PodSleuth (0.6.4)
      * Brasero   (0.8.1)
      * Avahi

    Packagers:
      * --with-vendor-build-id=<foo> should always be set and detail the distro 
        name and version (e.g. openSUSE 11.1), and the repository origin, such
        as 'Banshee Team PPA'; for example, the %distribution macro is used in
        the openSUSE Build Service, which expands to something like this:
        'home:gabrielburt:branches:Banshee / openSUSE_Factory'; also the
        build/configure time is stored along with the host OS and CPU

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be 
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the 
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the 
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

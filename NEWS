BETA RELEASE DISCLAIMER
===============================================================================

    This is the fourth release in the Banshee 1.0 series. This Beta 1 release 
    does not have feature parity with previous Banshee releases (the last 
    being Banshee 0.13.2). This means there are some features in this 
    release that users may have come to know and love in Banshee that are 
    missing for the time being. 

    However, although this is an Beta release, it is quite stable and has 
    many great new features and performance improvements which will be detailed
    later. It has also been designed to be both installed and run in parallel 
    with previous Banshee releases, so you can test the release out without 
    breaking your stable Banshee setup.

    Missing features include:

      * Some hardware support 
        - CD Burning

      * Some plugins have not yet been ported to the new 1.0 architecture:
        - Podcasting, DAAP/iTunes Music Sharing, Internet Radio
        - Recommendations, Batch Cover Art Fetching

    Do not despair, these features will be added back before the final 1.0 
    release. Many more features are projected to land in the Beta 2 release of
    Banshee 1.0. We expect releases in quick succession leading up to the
    final 1.0 release. 

    Please read the full release notes on the Banshee Wiki for more details:

===============================================================================
OTHER NOTES
===============================================================================

    These changes were made to ensure that you can run older Banshee releases
    in parallel with new Banshee releases:

    * The location of the user configuration directory for Banshee 1.x changed
      from ~/.config/banshee to ~/.config/banshee-1 (where ~/.config is defined
      by XDG policy)

    * The base GConf path used for storing settings via the GNOME backend
      changed from /apps/banshee to /apps/banshee-1; an XML configuration file
      will be used if the GNOME backend extension is not installed

    Packages are available from the openSUSE Build Service in the

    and openSUSE Factory are being built. We expect to target more
    distributions and older openSUSE/SLED releases as we approach the
    final 1.0 release:

DEPENDENCIES
===============================================================================

    * Mono 1.2.2 (.NET 2.0 Profile / gmcs)
    * SQlite 3.4
    * Gtk# 2.10
    * GStreamer 0.10.3

    * NDesk DBus (ndesk-dbus) 0.5

    * Mono.Addins (mono-addins) 0.3.1

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be 
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the 
    Banshee:Preview project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the 
    Banshee:Preview repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.


===============================================================================
NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.0 Beta 1 represents the fourth release since we began rewriting
    much of the core of Banshee. The primary reason for rewriting this core
    was to deliver much needed performance improvements.

    Banshee now uses much less memory and has greatly improved startup speed.
    It can handle collections that are much larger in size without adversely
    affecting application speed or memory usage.

    These core architectural changes also allowed us to cleanly implement
    many great new features and provides a framework for new features to
    be easily developed in the future.

    New features in this release include:

    * MTP and iPod Player Support
    * Default Smart Playlists
    * Extension Manager
    * Minimode extension

    Other features, bug fixes, and errata:

    * Fullscreen video is now supported (press f or go to Now Playing)
    * Banshee can be scripted using Boo
    * Improved gstreamer error handling (for missing files, codecs, etc)
    * A bug with play counts introduced in Alpha 3 has been fixed
    * Writing metadata to file is working properly now
    * Issues with the play queue should all be resolved
    * Limiting smart playlists by file size or duration works
    * Shuffle and repeat are automatically disabled while playing Last.fm
    * Over 30 bugs were fixed since Alpha 3

===============================================================================
REPORT BUGS - HELP THE PROJECT - GROW THE COMMUNITY
===============================================================================

    While this is an Beta Release, we have known it to be quite stable. There
    are some missing features though that will be added back as we
    progress towards the final 1.0 release of Banshee.

    If you encounter any bad behavior with this release, please do not
    hesitate to file bugs!

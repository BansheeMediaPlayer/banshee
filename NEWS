Banshee 0.10.4 is out!

This release features faster and more efficient source management, improved 
playlist support, a complete plugin system, and the first four official plugins. 
Plugins include DAAP (iTunes music share) support (client and server), cover
 art fetching, Audioscrobbler song submitting, and file system monitoring.

NEW FEATURES
------------

* New plugin system and management/configuration dialog; allows for easy 
loading/unloading of plugins while Banshee is running [1]

* DAAP (iTunes Music Share) plugin that provides the ability to browse and 
listen to songs over DAAP and publish the local Banshee database as a DAAP 
share for other clients to browse; features a light weight embedded web-server 
for proxying DAAP over HTTP which enables streaming within all supported media 
engines (GStreamer 0.8, GStreamer 0.10, Helix/RealPlayer, VLC). A simple 
web-based front-end to the DAAP is also available at http://localhost:8089 [2]

* Audioscrobbler plugin by Chris Toshok now features queue saving, main 
menu integration, and a configuration pane for entering account information

* Metadata Searcher plugin will download cover art automatically for songs 
in the library, and can optionally supplement or correct song metadtaa

* File System Monitor plugin can monitor the library directory in the file 
system and automatically import or remove songs added or removed from the 
file system

* Rewritten source management; sources are centrally managed and abstracted 
from the view; sources are accessible to plugins (DAAP plugin implements 
sources)

* Playlist support has been overhauled; much faster, and reordering a songs 
in a playlist now works properly

* All "legacy" transaction/threading code has been removed, resulting in 
various performance gains in many areas

* New popup window "tooltip" is displayed when hovering over the tray icon; 
shows cover art and track information

* Added "intelligent" shuffle that has a 60% chance of hovering inside the 
current genre, making the transitions between songs slightly more 
fluid. (Brad Taylor)

* New Czech translation by Lukas Novotny; other various translations 
have been updated

* Many other improvements and minor features


[1] For details on developing new plugins, please read the Plugin Developers 
Guide on the Banshee Wiki: http://banshee-project.org/Developers/Plugins

[2] The DAAP plugin requires at least the latest release of Avahi core and 
avahi-sharp from HEAD. The mDNS layer in the DAAP plugin is being rewritten 
to also work with the legacy mDNSResponder. The DAAP plugin can be disabled 
by passing --disable-daap to configure.

MORE NOTES
----------

* Please do not hesitate to file bugs against Banshee in GNOME Bugzilla
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, component: banshee), or discuss Banshee on
this list or in #banshee on irc.gnome.org. The Banshee Wiki, open to
everyone for viewing and editing is located at
http://banshee-project.org.


* Bindings to the VLC libraries have been implemented and are available
as a Banshee Media Engine. To use the VLC engine, pass --enable-vlc to
configure. Additionally, libvlc.so must be copied to
banshee/mediaengines/vlc before running "make install". To build
libvlc.so, download and build Jon Lech Johansen's snd123:

http://nanocrew.net/2005/09/20/snd123/

Copy the resulting libvlc.so to the aforementioned build directory, and
proceed with building Banshee as normal. Keep in mind, VLC support is
optional. Banshee also supports GStreamer and Helix engines. GStreamer
is required, and Helix is optional, but will be automatically detected
and configured if your system is set up properly with either RealPlayer
or Helix Player. See http://helixcommunity.org/

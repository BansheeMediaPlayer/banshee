NOTES
-----

- New versions of Banshee will be released every Thursday. Releases with an odd micro version number, are to be considered essentially CVS snapshots. Even micro version numbers will be considered more stable, and are subject to more testing than odd micro version numbers.

- To distributors: due to a bug in the Mono 1.1.8.x mcs compiler, Banshee code will not compile. Attempting to do so will result in the compiler crashing. Mono 1.1.9.2 must be used to build Banshee. However, the resulting assembly will execute just fine on the 1.1.8.x corlib/runtime. This means that Banshee can be built with 1.1.9.2 and run on 1.1.8.x. For distributions that cannot upgrade the compiler, the bare 1.1.9.2 compiler assembly has been bundled with banshee for now. To build using the bundled compiler, simply pass --with-internal-mcs to configure.

- Bindings to the VLC libraries have been implemented and are available as a Banshee Media Engine. To use the VLC engine, pass --enable-vlc to configure. Additionally, libvlc.so must be copied to banshee/mediaengines/vlc before running "make install". To build libvlc.so, download and build Jon Lech Johansen's snd123:

http://nanocrew.net/2005/09/20/snd123/

Copy the resulting libvlc.so to the aforementioned build directory, and proceed with building Banshee as normal. Keep in mind, VLC support is optional. Banshee also supports GStreamer and Helix engines. GStreamer is required, and Helix is optional, but will be automatically detected and configured if your system is set up properly with either RealPlayer or Helix Player.

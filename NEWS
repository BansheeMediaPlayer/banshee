Banshee 0.10.8 is out! 

NEW FEATURES
------------

 * New player engine system; fully abstracted from the user interface; 
 
 * Open Location dialog to play an arbitrary file/stream
 
 * Notification Area Icon moved into a plugin (Sebastian Dröge)
 
 * Bonjour/mDNSResponder resolver enhanced to use A DNS queries instead of
   gethostbyname
 
 * Helix backend rewritten as a separate program that uses DBus [1]
 
 * Improved DAAP support: works properly with mt-daap and Rhythmbox
 
NOTES
-----

[1] Helix support now requires a separate module, helix-dbus-server. In
order to allow for 64 bit Banshee packages, Helix had to be moved out of
process (no 64 bit Helix port). helix-dbus-server provides access to the 
Helix player over DBus.


BUG FIXES
---------

 * 329812: Not able to browse Rhythmbox DAAP share
 * 330230: Banshee fails to import album/directory into database.
 * 333793: Incorrect check for mono DLLs

MORE NOTES
----------

* Please do not hesitate to file bugs against Banshee in GNOME Bugzilla
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, component: banshee), or discuss Banshee on
this list or in #banshee on irc.gnome.org. The Banshee Wiki, open to
everyone for viewing and editing is located at

* Bindings to the VLC libraries have been implemented and are available
as a Banshee Media Engine. To use the VLC engine, pass --enable-vlc to
configure. Additionally, libvlc.so must be copied to
banshee/mediaengines/vlc before running "make install". To build
libvlc.so, download and build Jon Lech Johansen's snd123:

http://nanocrew.net/2005/09/20/snd123/

Copy the resulting libvlc.so to the aforementioned build directory, and
proceed with building Banshee as normal. Keep in mind, VLC support is
optional. Banshee also supports GStreamer and Helix engines. GStreamer
is required, and Helix is optional, but will be automatically detected
and configured if your system is set up properly with either RealPlayer
or Helix Player. See http://helixcommunity.org/

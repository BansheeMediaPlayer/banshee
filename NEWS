 Novell Bugzilla

 * 249494 - Ensure gdk_set_program_class is called so windows don't group
 * 248831 - Ensure local stations will load even if remote ones can't

Other untracked fixes
---------------------

 * Clicking Play in the radio source when nothing is playing already will
   now start playback based on selection in the station list

 * In the volume button, do not show the slider dock when scrolling, instead
   just show the tooltip

 * Audio profile configuration dialog can be resized in X direction and has
   a good minimum width; use TextViewLabel instead of Label to provide good
   word wrapping

NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.5.3 brings many big changes, new features, and fixes!

    New Features:

      * Sync device from playlist option

           Either manually manage what files are added/removed to your device,
           or choose a playlist to sync from.  You can make a size-limited smart
           playlist to sync just the right amount to your device.

      * Type-ahead find in track, artist, and album lists

           An alternative to filtering, type-ahead find jumps you to the first
           track to match your query.  Activate with shift+/, cancel with Esc,
           and jump to next match with F3.  In track list it matches against
           artist, album, or title.

      * Optional cover art in lower-left corner

          Turn on via View > Show Cover Art

      * Cover art editable via DnD and right-click

          Can edit via the cover art in the track editor, lower-left corner,
          and beside the seek-slider.

      * Audiobooks library extension

          Rough first version, main benefits are separating your books from
          your music and defining a different file system organization.  In
          future versions we plan to add intuitive bookmarking and a better
          browsing experience.  Enable in Extensions tab of Preferences.

      * Library-folder watcher extension

          Watches your libraries' folders for added, renamed, or deleted
          files, and updates your libraries appropriately.  Requires
          Mono >= 2.4.3.  Enable in Extensions tab of Preferences.

      * eMusic importer/downloader extension

          If you have purchased music from eMusic and have a .emx file, Banshee
          will download and import the music files for you.  Select
          'eMusic Files' from the normal Media > Import Media dialog. Enable
          in Extensions tab of Preferences.

      * GIO file backend, supports non-local files

          This backend uses the GIO library to support importing local files
          and network-share files alike.  Requires glib >= 2.22 and Gio#.

    Enhancements:

      * Improved Podcast filtering/browsing
      * Extension preferences tab reworked
      * Extension names/descriptions translated
      * Improved sqlite performance
      * Support for Nexus One devices

    Notable bug fixes:

      * DAPs (ipods, etc) should work on DeviceKit-using distros
      * Podcast renaming should work well now
      * Podcast download cancelling is now fast
      * Internet Archive results paging off-by-one fixed
      * Should build with older Mono/Gtk# again (eg on openSUSE 11.0)
      * Fix issue with MTP devices on 64-bit distros

      * N bugs were fixed since 1.5.2

    Binaries for Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5:

DEPENDENCIES
===============================================================================

    * Mono 1.9.1 (.NET 2.0 Profile / gmcs)
    * SQlite 3.4
    * Gtk# 2.12
    * GStreamer 0.10.12

    * NDesk DBus (ndesk-dbus) 0.5
    * NDesk DBus GLib (ndesk-dbus-glib) 0.3
    * Mono.Addins (mono-addins) 0.3.1
    * TagLib# (taglib-sharp) 2.0.3.2

    * Required to build default feature stack:
      * libmtp >= 0.2.0
        * Note to packagers: since libmtp has different .so files for
          different versions, you need to require in your package the same
          version of libmtp you used to build Banshee.
      * ipod-sharp >= 0.8.5
      * mono-zeroconf >= 0.8.0
      * boo >= 0.8.1
      * GIO support reequires glib >= 2.22 and gio-sharp and gtk-sharp-beans
      * Library Watcher extension requires Mono >= 2.4.3
      * Accessibilty for ListView and Rating widgets requires Gtk# >= 2.12.10

    * Run-time requirements for default feature stack:
      * PodSleuth (0.6.6 recommended)
      * Brasero   (0.8.1)
      * Avahi
      * gst-plugins-bad (providing the bpmdetect GStreamer plugin)

    Packagers:
      * --with-vendor-build-id=<foo> should always be set and detail the distro
        name and version (e.g. openSUSE 11.1), and the repository origin, such
        as 'Banshee Team PPA'; for example, the %distribution macro is used in
        the openSUSE Build Service, which expands to something like this:
        'home:gabrielburt:branches:Banshee / openSUSE_Factory'; also the
        build/configure time is stored along with the host OS and CPU

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.9.0 is a development release, the first of the 1.9.x series
    leading up to Banshee 2.0.

    New Features Since 1.8.0:

      * Artist/Album Browser Track Actions

            Track actions (play, queue, remove, delete, edit, properties)
            now work for the artist and album browser too!  Right click an
            artist or album to act on it, or click an album and press 'q' to
            queue it.

      * 'Play After' Queue Options

            Want to listen to a track, album, or artist right after the playing
            track, album, or artist?  The 'Play After' option will insert it
            into the queue to make it happen.

      * User Interface Improvements

            We have made several changes toward a cleaner and more usable UI.
            We got rid of the active source's title bar.  Search is now beside
            the volume button.  The source list has smaller icons, hidden
            counts for the libraries, and named group-separators.  The seek
            slider and search entry are resizable via their grips.

            Podcasts episodes are now shown in a grid, with several lines of
            description shown to help you find an appealing episode to enjoy.

    Enhancements:

      * Album grid has tooltips for ellipsized text
      * Subscribe to Internet Archive searches as podcasts
      * MusicBrainz cover art search supports CDBaby and Jamendo
      * Support Huawei Ideos Android phones

    Notable Bugs Fixed (51 fixed since 1.8.0):

      * bgo#631172: [AppleDevice] Fix podcast support
      * bgo#540503: Remove Jump... from context menu

      * bgo#630039: Concatenated and untranslatable string
      * bgo#631277: Crash in when editing some tracks' metadata

      * bgo#633579: Fixup not getting reloaded correctly
      * bgo#633764: [Dap] not transcoding some files when we should
      * bgo#633841: Recognize webm as video
      * bgo#634096: Empty track # in filename patterns

    * SQlite 3.4
    * Gtk# 2.12
    * GStreamer 0.10.12

    * Required to build default feature stack:
      * libmtp >= 0.2.0
        * Note to packagers: since libmtp has different .so files for
          different versions, you need to require in your package the same
          version of libmtp you used to build Banshee.
      * mono-zeroconf >= 0.8.0
      * boo >= 0.8.1
      * GIO support requires glib >= 2.22, gio-sharp and gtk-sharp-beans
      * Library Watcher extension requires Mono >= 2.4.3
      * Accessibilty for ListView and Rating widgets requires Gtk# >= 2.12.10

        gdata-sharp-youtube >= 1.4
      * Amazon MP3 Store, Wikipedia Context Pane, and Miro Guide require
        webkit-1.0 >= 1.2.2
      * GIO/udev-based hardware backend requires glib >= 2.22, gio-sharp,
        gtk-sharp-beans, gudev-sharp and gkeyfile-sharp
      * Apple Devices backend requires libgpod-sharp >= 0.7.95

    * Run-time requirements for default feature stack:
      * GIO/udev
      * Brasero >= 0.8.1
      * Avahi
      * gst-plugins-bad (providing the bpmdetect GStreamer plugin)

    Packagers:
      * --with-vendor-build-id=<foo> should always be set and detail the distro
        name and version (e.g. openSUSE 11.1), and the repository origin, such
        as 'Banshee Team PPA'; for example, the %distribution macro is used in
        the openSUSE Build Service, which expands to something like this:
        'home:gabrielburt:branches:Banshee / openSUSE_Factory'; also the
        build/configure time is stored along with the host OS and CPU

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

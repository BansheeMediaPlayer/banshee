Banshee 0.11.0

"Import, organize, play, and share your music using Banshee's simple, 
powerful interface. Rip CDs, play and sync your iPod, create playlists, 
and burn audio CDs. Most portable music devices are supported. Banshee 
also has support for podcasting, smart playlists, music recommendations, 
and much more."


MODULE NOTES
------------

 * Banshee is now made up of the core module, banshee, and the official 
   plugins module, banshee-official-plugins

 * banshee-official-plugins is recommended, but not required to run Banshee

 * libipoddevice (0.5.0) and ipod-sharp (0.6.2) are required for iPod support


NEW CORE FEATURES
-----------------

 * Improved importing, all tagging is now done through taglib-sharp; better
   support for ID3, AAC/MP4, and ASF/WMA reading; all formats now support 
   writing

 * Import selections or all contents of a digital audio player (iPod) 
   directly to the local music library

 * Redesigned track editor allows for the most efficient editing of albums:
   enter the album information once, and then set track titles simply by
   pressing 'Enter' in the title box. A rating entry was added as well, and
   if turned on in Banshee Preferences, changes can now be saved back to
   files

 * New CD burning interface - create mixed CDs as sources that allow 
   burning songs from any number of sources: library, remote share, iPod;
   works with new GNOME 2.16 CD Burning API yet still compatible with 
   GNOME 2.12

 * Smart playlists allow defining a playlist based on selection criteria 
   that queries against and automatically reflects changes in your library. 
   The easy to use editor makes defining new smart playlists a snap.

 * One-click track rating; just click the desired rating on the track row

 * Redesigned Preferences dialog - simple and follows GNOME HIG; allows
   for turning on 'Write metadata to files'

 * Notification bubbles on track change using libnotify


NEW OFFICIAL PLUGINS FEATURES
-----------------------------

These features are found in the banshee-official-plugins module, not in 
Banshee core:

 * The new recommendations pane lets you browse similar artist recommendations 
   found on last.fm (http://www.last.fm/group/banshee) as you listen; you can 
   even re-discover related music already in your library that you may 
   have been neglecting

 * The podcast source offers an easy to use interface for subscribing to, 
   downloading, managing, and listening to your favorite shows.

 * Use the Mini Mode feature to condense the interface and gain valuable 
   desktop space. Switch between your library, playlists, and devices 
   within Mini Mode.

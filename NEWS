Banshee 2.1.0 - NOT YET RELEASED
===============================================================================

    Banshee 2.0 is the culmination of six months' work by 36 developers and
    dozens of translators, bug reporters, and testers.  It is a stable release,
    the successor to Banshee 1.8.

    New Features:

      * Artist/Album Browser Track Actions

            Track actions (play, queue, remove, delete, edit, properties)
            now work for the artist and album browser too!  Right click an
            artist or album to act on it, or click an album and press 'q' to
            queue it.

      * 'Play After' Queue Options

            Want to listen to a track, album, or artist right after the playing
            track, album, or artist?  The 'Play After' option will insert it
            into the queue to make it happen.

      * User Interface Improvements

            We have made several changes toward a cleaner and more usable UI.
            We got rid of the active source's title bar.  Search is now beside
            the volume button.  The source list has smaller icons, hidden
            counts for the libraries, and named group-separators.  The seek
            slider and search entry are resizable via their grips.

            Podcasts episodes are now shown in a grid, with several lines of
            description shown to help you find an appealing episode to enjoy.

      * Ubuntu One Music Store and SoundMenu Extensions

            These two extensions have been moved from Banshee Community
            Extensions and are now core Banshee extensions.

      * Subtitles

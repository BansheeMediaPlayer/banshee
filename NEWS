The Banshee 0.10.12 release is mostly a fixes-only release. As such, a few
important bug fixes were made, and Banshee was updated to work with the
libnautilus-burn/nautilus-cd-burner shipped with GNOME 2.15.x.

CHANGES SINCE 0.10.11
---------------------

  * Work with libnautilus-burn 2.15.3+ (emulation layer for 2.12/2.14 API)

  * Added CD-ROM door locking; when ripping a CD, the drive will lock 
    to prevent a hardware eject, if supported. If locking is not supported
    a hang/crash is now prevented when a rip is canceled via hardware

  * Do not crash on exit if events have come from NetworkManager

  * Translations all updated to what shipped with SUSE Linux Enterprise
    Desktop 10. Added new Hungarian, Polish, and Chinese (Traditional) 
    translations from SLED

  * The cover art popup will scale to a maximum of 75% of the screen

  * Handle exception when trying to burn CD on a system with no CD writers

  * Fix a crash when attempting to remove a track from the local queue

  * Build properly with Gtk# 2.10

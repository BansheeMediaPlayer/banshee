Banshee 0.10.5 is out!

This release features a new database layer, which addresses potential locking
issues in 0.10.4. A new official plugin was added that allows for special
multimedia key support, configurable through the Gnome keyboard shortcuts
capplet.


NOTES
-----

This release contains mainly bug fixes. Gtk# 2.8 and GTK+ 2.8 is now a
requirement as Gtk# 2.8 is now stable and most distributions should be
shipping it.


NEW FEATURES
------------

 * New queued/single-threaded database layer; much safer and potentially
   faster in some areas
 
 * Multimedia keys plugin by Danilo Reinhardt
 
 * Improved custom source API. Sources can now provide custom or hybrid
   views. See the banshee-sample-plugin module in Banshee subversion:
      svn://svn.banshee-project.org/trunk/banshee-sample-plugin
   
 * Improved search entry; uses stock/theme icons now
 
 * Improved volume widget; +/- are now clickable (Ruben Vermeersch)
 
 * Banshee now shows up in process listings (top, gnome system monitor) as
   'banshee' (not 'mono'); and 'killall banshee' will now work

MORE NOTES
----------

* Please do not hesitate to file bugs against Banshee in GNOME Bugzilla
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, component: banshee), or discuss Banshee on
this list or in #banshee on irc.gnome.org. The Banshee Wiki, open to
everyone for viewing and editing is located at
http://banshee-project.org.


* Bindings to the VLC libraries have been implemented and are available
as a Banshee Media Engine. To use the VLC engine, pass --enable-vlc to
configure. Additionally, libvlc.so must be copied to
banshee/mediaengines/vlc before running "make install". To build
libvlc.so, download and build Jon Lech Johansen's snd123:

http://nanocrew.net/2005/09/20/snd123/

Copy the resulting libvlc.so to the aforementioned build directory, and
proceed with building Banshee as normal. Keep in mind, VLC support is
optional. Banshee also supports GStreamer and Helix engines. GStreamer
is required, and Helix is optional, but will be automatically detected
and configured if your system is set up properly with either RealPlayer
or Helix Player. See http://helixcommunity.org/

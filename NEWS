===============================================================================
NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.6 is a stable release, the culmination of a year's work.  There
    are so many new features, bug fixes, and polish in this release, we won't
    be able to do it all justice in these notes, but we'll try.

    New Features Since 1.4.3:

      1.5.5
      * Gapless Playback / Playbin2

          Banshee now uses the playbin2 GStreamer element.  With this comes
          support for gapless playback, which is the default now for users
          with GStreamer > 0.10.25.2.

      * Grid View

          We are debuting a new grid mode for our custom list widget, visible
          in the modified Album browser.  It will be used for Videos,
          Audiobooks, and more in future releases.

      * YouTube Extension

          This extension shows YouTube videos in the Context Pane related to
          what you're playing, and lets you watch them within Banshee.  You
          can enable it in the Extensions tab of the Preferences dialog.

      1.5.4
      * Opt-In Usage Data Collection

          Under Preferences, you can choose to "Improve Banshee by sending
          anonymous usage data" back to the Banshee developers.  This collects
          information on what version you're running, what OS, library size,
          slow SQL queries, and a whitelisted subset of your preferences. This
          information will help us choose better defaults and see what parts of
          Banshee are used most and can be improved. All collected data is
          anonymous!

      * Default Equalizer Presets

          Banshee now ships with several equalizer presets, and the core of
          the equalizer management has seen much internal improvement.

      * Banshee Community Extensions

          A new sub-project named Banshee Community Extensions has been
          created.  Its code is hosted on Gitorious, and its bugs tracked
          in bugzilla.gnome.org.  It already contains 9 extensions, including
          AlarmClock, Lyrics, and Mirage, and has 15 maintainers.  Its releases
          track Banshee's; for more information, see

            http://banshee-project.org/download/extensions/

      * Extensible Shuffle Modes

          Extensions can now add new shuffle modes and PlayQueue fill-by
          modes.  The Mirage extension is the first to take advantage of this,
          adding a Shuffle/Fill-by Similar mode based on acoustical analysis.

      1.5.3
      * Sync device from playlist option

          Either manually manage what files are added/removed to your device,
          or choose a playlist to sync from.  You can make a size-limited smart
          playlist to sync just the right amount to your device.

      * Type-ahead find in track, artist, and album lists

          An alternative to filtering, type-ahead find jumps you to the first
          track to match your query.  Activate with shift+/, cancel with Esc,
          and jump to next match with F3.  In track list it matches against
          artist, album, or title.

      * Optional cover art in lower-left corner

          Turn on via View > Show Cover Art

      * Cover art editable via drag-and-drop and right-click

          Can edit via the cover art in the track editor, lower-left corner,
          and beside the seek-slider.

      * Audiobooks library extension

          Rough first version, main benefits are separating your books from
          your music and defining a different file system organization.  In
          future versions we plan to add intuitive bookmarking and a better
          browsing experience.  Enable in Extensions tab of Preferences.

      * Library-folder watcher extension

          Watches your libraries' folders for added, renamed, or deleted
          files, and updates your libraries appropriately.  Requires
          Mono >= 2.4.3.  Enable in Extensions tab of Preferences.

      * eMusic importer/downloader extension

          If you have purchased music from eMusic and have a .emx file, Banshee
          will download and import the music files for you.  Select
          'eMusic Files' from the normal Media > Import Media dialog. Enable
          in Extensions tab of Preferences.

      * GIO file backend, supports non-local files

          This backend uses the GIO library to support importing local files
          and network-share files alike.  Requires glib >= 2.22 and Gio#.

      * Return of the Mac OS X release

          OS X 10.5 and 10.6 is now supported again (but still considered
          beta quality). Additionally, Mono and GTK are now bundled with the
          binary release, so there are no dependencies for OS X users.

===============================================================================
DEPENDENCIES
===============================================================================

    * Mono 1.9.1 (.NET 2.0 Profile / gmcs)
    * SQlite 3.4
    * Gtk# 2.12
    * GStreamer 0.10.12

    * NDesk DBus (ndesk-dbus) 0.5
    * NDesk DBus GLib (ndesk-dbus-glib) 0.3
    * Mono.Addins (mono-addins) 0.3.1
    * TagLib# (taglib-sharp) >= 2.0.3.7

    * Required to build default feature stack:
      * libmtp >= 0.2.0
        * Note to packagers: since libmtp has different .so files for
          different versions, you need to require in your package the same
          version of libmtp you used to build Banshee.
      * ipod-sharp >= 0.8.5
      * mono-zeroconf >= 0.8.0
      * boo >= 0.8.1
      * GIO support requires glib >= 2.22, gio-sharp and gtk-sharp-beans
      * Library Watcher extension requires Mono >= 2.4.3
      * Accessibilty for ListView and Rating widgets requires Gtk# >= 2.12.10
      * Wikipedia extensions requires webkit-sharp-1.0 >= 0.2
      * YouTube extension requires gdata-sharp-core and
        gdata-sharp-youtube >= 1.4

    * Run-time requirements for default feature stack:
      * PodSleuth >= 0.6.6
      * Brasero >= 0.8.1
      * Avahi
      * gst-plugins-bad (providing the bpmdetect GStreamer plugin)

    Packagers:
      * --with-vendor-build-id=<foo> should always be set and detail the distro
        name and version (e.g. openSUSE 11.1), and the repository origin, such
        as 'Banshee Team PPA'; for example, the %distribution macro is used in
        the openSUSE Build Service, which expands to something like this:
        'home:gabrielburt:branches:Banshee / openSUSE_Factory'; also the
        build/configure time is stored along with the host OS and CPU

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

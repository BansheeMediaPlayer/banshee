NEW AWESOME FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================================================

    Banshee 1.5.5 is mostly a bug fix release, with a few enhancements.  This
    release marks the start of our string freeze in preparation for 1.6.

    New Features:

      * Gapless Playback / Playbin2

          Banshee now uses the playbin2 GStreamer element.  With this comes
          support for gapless playback, which is the default now for users
          with GStreamer > 0.10.25.2.

      * Grid View

          We are debuting a new grid mode for our custom list widget, visible
          in the modified Album browser.  It will be used for Videos,
          Audiobooks, and more in future releases.

      * YouTube Extension

          This extension shows YouTube videos in the Context Pane related to
          what you're playing, and lets you watch them within Banshee.  You
          can enable it in the Extensions tab of the Preferences dialog.

    Enhancements:

      * Improve search responsiveness on large libraries
      * Add icons for Nexus One and Audiobooks
      * Play Queue item count, size, duration now ignores old tracks
      * Muinshee fixes: disable Auto-DJ, allow reordering, hide previous song

    Notable bug fixes:

      * Fix a very common, SQL-related crash in 1.5.4
      * Fix saving equalizer settings in culture-invariant way
      * Jumping to a source's prefs via its context menu works again
      * Usage data not submitted more than every 48 hours
      * Fix repeatedly resyncing some files to a device b/c transcoded
      * Clear the redo stack on shuffle mode change
      * Accept feeds with empty title
      * Uri encode file location queries, making them work properly
      * Fixes to the OS X build

      * 26 bugs were fixed since 1.5.4

    * Required to build default feature stack:
      * libmtp >= 0.2.0
        * Note to packagers: since libmtp has different .so files for
          different versions, you need to require in your package the same
          version of libmtp you used to build Banshee.
      * ipod-sharp >= 0.8.5
      * mono-zeroconf >= 0.8.0
      * boo >= 0.8.1
      * GIO support requires glib >= 2.22, gio-sharp and gtk-sharp-beans
      * Library Watcher extension requires Mono >= 2.4.3
      * Accessibilty for ListView and Rating widgets requires Gtk# >= 2.12.10
      * Wikipedia extensions requires webkit-sharp-1.0 >= 0.2
      * YouTube extension requires gdata-sharp-core and

      * Brasero >= 0.8.1
      * Avahi
      * gst-plugins-bad (providing the bpmdetect GStreamer plugin)

    Packagers:
      * --with-vendor-build-id=<foo> should always be set and detail the distro
        name and version (e.g. openSUSE 11.1), and the repository origin, such
        as 'Banshee Team PPA'; for example, the %distribution macro is used in
        the openSUSE Build Service, which expands to something like this:
        'home:gabrielburt:branches:Banshee / openSUSE_Factory'; also the
        build/configure time is stored along with the host OS and CPU

    Please note that for openSUSE, all of the dependencies above can be
    found in the openSUSE Build Service, and are linked into the
    Banshee project. Even if you build from source, if you wish
    to avoid building the entire dependency chain above, add the
    Banshee repository to your repository list.

    Historically, Banshee has fostered development of a number of projects
    and bundled their source code instead of depending on external builds.
    Many of these dependencies have matured and grown into well maintained
    projects on their own, and we are now depending on them externally. We
    waited to remove the bundles long enough to allow for distributions to
    ship packages to reduce the pain of building Banshee.

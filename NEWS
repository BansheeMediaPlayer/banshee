Banshee 0.10.6 is out!

This release features much improved iPod support. A few large bugs were
fixed regarding iPod syncing, and a database reconstruction was added
if Banshee ever encounters an iPod database it cannot read (iTunes frequently
updates the database format). 


NOTES
-----

This release requires ipod-sharp 0.5.15 for iPod support. Installing 
libipoddevice 0.4.1 is recommended (especially if you have HAL 0.5.6+), 
though not required.


NEW FEATURES
------------

 * If an unsupported iPod database is encountered, Banshee will offer
 to scan the iPod and reconstruct a database; either way, unsupported
 database errors are handled very gracefully now
 
 * Use cover.jpg/folder.jpg and others as cover art if it exists
 
 * Improved startup time 

 * Thai translation by Theppitak Karoonboonyanan
 
 * ipod-sharp now has fixed logic for syncing, fixes a few bugs
 
 * libipoddevice 0.4.1 can be used which now supports ejecting over HAL/DBus

MORE NOTES
----------

* Please do not hesitate to file bugs against Banshee in GNOME Bugzilla
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, component: banshee), or discuss Banshee on
this list or in #banshee on irc.gnome.org. The Banshee Wiki, open to

* Bindings to the VLC libraries have been implemented and are available
as a Banshee Media Engine. To use the VLC engine, pass --enable-vlc to
configure. Additionally, libvlc.so must be copied to
banshee/mediaengines/vlc before running "make install". To build
libvlc.so, download and build Jon Lech Johansen's snd123:

http://nanocrew.net/2005/09/20/snd123/

Copy the resulting libvlc.so to the aforementioned build directory, and
proceed with building Banshee as normal. Keep in mind, VLC support is
optional. Banshee also supports GStreamer and Helix engines. GStreamer
is required, and Helix is optional, but will be automatically detected
and configured if your system is set up properly with either RealPlayer
or Helix Player. See http://helixcommunity.org/

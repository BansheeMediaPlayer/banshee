  <title>Sync</title>

  <p><app>Banshee</app> supports syncing your music to portable media players
  and smartphones. You can add specific music tracks, albums or playlist or
  allow <app>Banshee</app> to keep your music player in sync with your entire
  library. After your player is connected to your computer you can also play
  back the songs on your portable player in <app>Banshee</app>. When syncing
  music in a lossless format, such as FLAC, <app>Banshee</app> will
  automatically transcode your music for you to a lossy format such as Ogg
  Vorbis or MP3, if you have the correct codecs installed.</p>

  <section id="devices">
    <title>Device support</title>

  <p><app>Banshee</app> supports almost all modern portable music players and
  smartphones with the notable exception of the Apple iPhone, iPad and
  iPod Touch.</p>

  <p>When you plug your device in, <app>Banshee</app> will display it in the
  left menu. Pressing the device icon will take you to your device home page
  in <app>Banshee</app> displaying your sync preferences.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="sync-settings">
    <title>Sync your music</title>

  <p>You can choose to manage the media on your portable music by having
  <app>Banshee</app> automatically sync it or manage your music and media
  manually.</p>

  <p>Choose your device from the <app>Banshee</app> menu and then choose how
  you want to sync your media, including:</p>

  <list>
    <item><p>Music</p></item>
    <item><p>Audiobooks</p></item>
    <item><p>Videos</p></item>
    <item><p>Podcasts</p></item>
  </list>

  <p>From the dropdown menu next to each of the media, choose from:</p>

  <list>
    <item><p>Manage manually</p></item>
    <item><p>Sync entire library</p></item>
  </list>

  <note style="warning">
    <p>If you choose to sync your entire library automatically with your
    portable media player make sure your portable media player has enough
    storage space. If your library is larger than the space on your portable
    media player, <app>Banshee</app> will sync media until your player is full
    and then stop.</p>
  </note>

  <p>If you have created playlists or smart playlists in your music library,
  they will also be displayed as a sync option for Music. This can be helpful
  when creating smart playlists, as smart playlists will automatically update
  as new content is added based on the playlist rules, and <app>Banshee</app>
  will sync the new playlist to your device every time you plug it in.</p>

  <p><app>Banshee</app> will display the total hard drive space of your
  portable music player in a graph in the bottom center of <app>Banshee</app>.
  The graph will show you how much space is taken by audio files, video, other
  and free space. Directly below that <app>Banshee</app> will show you how
  many total items are stored on your portable music player, how many hours or
  days of listening that is equal to, and total space used.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="sync-manually">
    <title>Sync your entire library</title>

  <p>You can drag and drop media to your portable music player from
  <app>Banshee</app>. Select the file or files you want to copy to your
  portable media player and then press and hold your right mouse button and
  drag the file(s) to your portable media player icon in <app>Banshee</app>.
  This will copy the files to your device.</p>

  <p>If your music library is encoded in a format that your portable media
  player does not support, such as OGG or FLAC, and you have the necessary
  codecs installed, <app>Banshee</app> can automatically transcode these files
  to MP3 when transferring to your portable media player. Check with your Linux
  distribution for the necessary codecs as it is outside the scope of this help
  and varies by distribution.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>You may need to eject your device to load the files correctly on your
    portable music player. To eject your device in <app>Banshee</app>, using
    your mouse right click the device in the <app>Banshee</app> menu and press
    <gui style="menuitem">Disconnect</gui>.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="pmp-play">
    <title>Play music from your portable music player</title>

  <p>You can play music stored on your portable music player directly in
  <app>Banshee</app>. Choose your player in the <app>Banshee</app> menu on the
  left and your portable music player's library will be displayed. You can then
  play music in <app>Banshee</app> just as you would music in your own
  library.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="pmp-delete">
    <title>Remove music from your portable music player</title>

  <p>To remove songs stored on your portable music player, choose your player
  in <app>Banshee</app> to view its library. Then choose the tracks you would
  like to remove and right click the tracks and choose
  <gui style="menuitem">Delete</gui> or from the menu choose
  <guiseq><gui style="menu">Edit</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">Delete</gui></guiseq>.</p>

  <note style="warning">
    <p>Deleting files from your portable music player will permanently remove
    the files and you will not be able to recover them.</p>

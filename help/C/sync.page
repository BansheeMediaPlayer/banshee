  <title>Sync</title>    
  
  <p>Banshee supports syncing your music to portable media players and 
  smartphones.  You can add specific music tracks, albums or playlist 
  or allow Banshee to keep your music player in sync with your entire
  library.  After your player is connected to your computer you can also
  play back the songs on your portable player in Banshee.  When syncing
  music in a lossless format, such as FLAC, Banshee will automatically
  transcode your music for you to a lossy format such as Ogg Vorbis or MP3,
  if you have the correct codecs installed.

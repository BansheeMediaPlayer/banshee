  <title>What is a podcast?</title>

  <p>Podcasts are recorded programs, similar to radio programs, that are
  available on the internet and allow you to subscribe to them. When you
  subscribe to a podcast in <app>Banshee</app>, each time a new program is
  released, <app>Banshee</app> will automatically download the podcast to your
  library.</p>

  <p>Podcasts have been made on almost any subject, including music, movies,
  Linux and more. Search the internet using your favorite search engine with a
  search term such as "Linux podcast" and you will be presented with many
  options to choose from.</p>

    <title>Add a podcast</title>

  <p>To add a podcast to <app>Banshee</app>, you will first need to visit the
  podcast home page. Most podcasts will have a button or link displayed to
  subscribe to the podcast. Copy the link to the podcast subscription feed. In
  most web browsers, you can right click on the link and choose
  <gui style="menuitem">Copy link</gui>.</p>

  <p>In <app>Banshee</app>, click <gui style="menuitem">Podcast</gui> in the
  menu on the left side of the window. Then, click
  <gui style="menuitem">Subscribe to Podcasts</gui> in the right half of the
  toolbar, from the menu choose <guiseq><gui style="menu">Media</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">Subscribe to Podcast</gui></guiseq> or use the keyboard
  shortcut <keyseq><key>Shift</key><key>Control</key><key>F</key></keyseq>.</p>

  <p>By default, the podcasts will not be downloaded, so you will only be able
  to listen to them while you are connected to the internet. When you subscribe
  to a new podcast, you will be able to select the following options:</p>

  <list>
    <item>
      <p>Select <gui style="checkbox">Download new episodes</gui> to
      automatically download any new episodes to your computer so that you can
      access them when you do not have an internet connection.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Select <gui style="menuitem">Archive all episodes except the newest
      one</gui> to have only the newest episode displayed.</p>
    </item>
  </list>

  <p>After you have added a podcast feed, <app>Banshee</app> will display the
  name of the podcast, the title of each episode and the date that it was
  published on.</p>

  <p>Once a podcast has been archived, it will be removed from the <gui>New
  Items</gui> list, but it will still appear in the <gui>All Items</gui>
  list.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>You can edit the subscription options the <gui style="menuitem">Podcast
    Properties</gui>, which can be accessed by right clicking on the
    corresponding podcast name in the podcast list or by right clicking on any
    episode of that podcast.</p>

     <title>What is a Podcast?</title>
     
  <p>Podcasts are recorded programs similar to radio programs that are
  available on the internet and allow you to subscribe.  When you subscribe
  to a podcast in Banshee, each time a new program is released, Banshee
  will automatically download the podcast and allow you to listen to it.</p>
  
  <p>There are podcasts on almost any subject including music, movies, Linux
  and more.  Search the internet using your favorite search engine with a 
  search term such as "movie podcast" and you will be presented with many 
  options to choose from.</p>

  to the podcast's subscription.  In most web browsers, you can right click
  on the link and choose <gui>Copy link</gui>.

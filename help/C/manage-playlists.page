  <title>Playlists</title>

  <p>Playlists allow you to create and save a list of music tracks to be
  played in a specific order. Playlists are convenient to create a list of your
  favorite songs or to split your library into smaller lists that are easy to
  browse through. Some portable media players even allow you to transfer the
  playlist so you can take it with you on the go.</p>

  <p><app>Banshee</app> supports normal playlists, which include songs you add
  to the playlist, as well as smart playlists. Smart Playlists are
  automatically generated playlists based on your listening habits, favorite
  music, or more.</p>

    <title>Normal playlists</title>

  <p>A normal playlist is a list of songs that you add and manage. You might
  want to create your own list of songs by your favorite artist from multiple
  albums, your latest favorite songs, or an upbeat playlist to listen to while
  you exercise.</p>

  <p>You can create a new playlist by pressing <keyseq><key>Control</key>
  <key>N</key></keyseq>, from the menu choosing
  <guiseq><gui style="menu">Media</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">New Playlist</gui></guiseq> or
  by selecing the track(s) you would like to add to the playlist. Select the
  track(s), right click them, and choose
  <guiseq><gui style="menuitem">Add to Playlist</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">New Playlist</gui></guiseq>. You can
  also drag and drop them to a new playlist by selecting the track(s) and
  dragging them to the left hand window pane over <gui>Music</gui>. As you
  drag it over <gui>Music</gui>, a new option
  <gui style="menuitem"><em>New Playlist</em></gui> will appear and you
  can drop the track(s) over
  <gui style="menuitem"><em>New Playlist</em></gui> to add them to the
  playlist. You can repeat this process until you have added all the
  tracks you want in the playlist.</p>

  <p>To give your playlist its own name, select the playlist and right click
  on the playlist and press <gui style="menuitem">Rename Playlist</gui> and
  enter the name of your playlist.</p>

  <p>You can change the order of the playlist by dragging and dropping the
  song to the new position in the playlist. Songs can only be re-ordered
  in the playlist when none of the columns are sorted. To unsort a column,
  press the column until the up or down arrow is no longer showing and
  the column is blank and then re-order the playlist.</p>

  <p>To remove a track from the playlist, select the track(s) you wish to
  remove. Press the <key>Delete</key>, from the menu choose
  <guiseq><gui style="menu">Edit</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">Remove from Playlist</gui></guiseq>
  or right click the track(s) with your mouse and press
  <gui style="menuitem">Remove from Playlist</gui>.</p>

    <title>Smart playlist</title>

  <p>Smart Playlists allow you to quickly generate a dynamic playlist based on
  a number of pre-set variables. You can quickly create a new playlist based
  on a specific artist, favorites or more.</p>

  <p>To create a new Smart Playlist, from the menu choose
  <guiseq><gui style="menu">Media</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">New Smart Playlist</gui></guiseq>.
  You will be presented with a dialog to create a new
  Smart Playlist. Enter the name of your playlist and then choose the criteria
  your playlist should be based on. You can choose from any field included in
  the song's metadata, such as Album, Artist or Year. Choose the criteria and
  then choose from one of the following:</p>

    <list>
      <item><p>is</p></item>
      <item><p>is not</p></item>
      <item><p>less than</p></item>
      <item><p>more than</p></item>
      <item><p>at most</p></item>
      <item><p>at least</p></item>
    </list>

  <p>You can also press the <gui style="button">+</gui> button to add an
  addition query to the Smart Playlist. For example, you could create a smart
  playlist that includes all songs from 2010 that you rated 5 stars. To create
  this playlist you would choose:</p>

  <table frame="all" rules="rows" shade="rows">
  <tr>
    <td><p><gui>Year</gui></p></td>
    <td><p><gui>is</gui></p></td>
    <td><p>2010</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><gui>Rating</gui></p></td>
    <td><p><gui>is</gui></p></td>
    <td><p>5 stars</p></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <p>You can then optionally select how many songs are included by pressing
  the <gui style="checkbox">Limit to</gui> checkbox and choosing the number of
  songs to be included.</p>

  <p><app>Banshee</app> also includes smart playlists already created for you.
  Press the <gui style="button">Open in editor</gui> button to view how the
  playlist was created, or to modify it. If you press
  <gui style="button">Create and save</gui>
  the playlist will be automatically generated and saved for
  you. The following playlists are included:</p>

  <list>
    <title><app>Banshee</app> smart playlists</title>
    <item>
      <p>Favorites (Songs rated four and five stars)</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Recent Favorites (Songs listened to often in the past week)</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Recently Added (Songs imported within the last week)</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Unheard (Songs that have not been played or skipped)</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Neglected Favorites (Favorites not played in over two months)</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>700 MB of Favorites (A data CD worth of favorite songs)</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>80 Minutes of Favorites (An audio CD worth of favorite songs)</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Unrated (Songs that haven't been rated)</p>
    </item>
  </list>

  <p>Last.fm is a popular online service that offers both free and paid
  versions. Last.fm offers information on music artists and albums and if you

  <app>Banshee</app> for free. If you subscribe as a paying member, you can
  also listen to streaming music from Last.fm in various music clients,
  including <app>Banshee</app>. Last.fm offers multiple channels to stream,
  including recommended music for you based on your listening habits, your
  favorites and more.</p>

    <title>Enable Last.fm</title>

  <p>To get the most out of Last.fm, you will want to create a Last.fm
  profile.  Visit <link
  href="http://www.last.fm/join">http://www.last.fm/join</link> to create an
  account or choose <guiseq><gui style="menu">Edit</gui>
  <gui style="menuitem">Preferences</gui></guiseq>
  from the <app>Banshee</app> menu.
  Once in the preferences select the <gui style="tab">Source Specific</gui>
  tab, press the <gui style="menu">Source</gui> drop down menu, choose
  <gui style="menuitem">Last.fm</gui> and finally select the <em>Sign up for
  Last.fm</em> link.</p>

  <p>To enable <app>Banshee</app> to report the songs you play on your
  computer to Last.fm, sign in to Last.fm in <app>Banshee</app> in the
  <gui style="tab">Source Specific</gui> preferences. Enter your username

  <section id="song-reporting">
    <title>Enable Last.fm song reporting from <app>Banshee</app></title>

  <p>After you have successfully linked <app>Banshee</app> to your Last.fm
  profile you must ensure that you have enabled <app>Banshee</app> to report
  your songs. To enable <app>Banshee</app> to report the songs to your Last.fm
  profile go to <app>Banshee</app> and select preferences, then select the
  <gui style="tab">Source Specific</gui> tab, select
  <gui style="menuitem">Last.fm</gui> from the dropdown, and press the
  <gui style="checkbox">Enable Song Reporting From <app>Banshee</app></gui>
  checkbox. If you have an active internet connection <app>Banshee</app> will
  now send Last.fm information regarding the songs you play. To view your play
  history visit your profile on the Last.fm website. Last.fm will automatically
  update your music metadata if any of your artist, song title, or album
  information is incorrect (although we recommend that you use the Metadata
  Fixer extension to correct your files instead).</p>

  <section id="device-song-reporting">
    <title>Enable Last.fm song reporting from your device</title>

  <p>After successfully linking <app>Banshee</app> to your Last.fm profile and
  enabling <app>Banshee</app> to report songs to Last.fm you can also enable
  scrobbling from a connected device. <app>Banshee</app> will, upon connection
  of your device, attempt to scrobble the songs you have played since the
  device was last connected and submit them to Last.fm.</p>

  <p>To enable scrobbling of a connected device go to <app>Banshee</app> and
  select Preferences, select the <gui style="tab">Source Specific</gui> tab,
  select <gui style="menuitem">Last.fm</gui> from the dropdown, and press the
  <gui style="checkbox">Enable Song Reporting From Device</gui> checkbox. If
  you have an active internet connection <app>Banshee</app> will, upon
  connection of your device, now attempt to gather information regarding the
  songs that you have played since it was last connected.</p>

  <p>As with regular <app>Banshee</app> scrobbling submissions Last.fm will
  automatically update your music metadata if any of your artist, title, or
  album information is incorrect (although we again recommend that you use the
  Metadata Fixer extension to correct your files instead).</p>

  <p>Please note that currently <app>Banshee</app> only supports this feature
  with Apple products that are supported by the AppleDevice extension.</p>

The following items are on the radar.  Feel free to work on them.

Bugs:
• provide better UI feedback when switching stations/fetching songs
• disable shuffle, sorting, and already played tracks (that won't work if
  you manually try to play them again)
• sometimes tracks simply don't play.  sometimes pressing pause/play helps this.

Features:
• discovery mode (subscribers only, only plays new music)
• support songs w/ free download URL
• love/hate support
• obscure/popular for recommendation station
• combined stations - mix of several other stations
• event info (part of recommendations plugin?)

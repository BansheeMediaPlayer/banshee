The following items are on the radar.  Feel free to work on them.

Bugs:
• sometimes a station will load a new playlist, but it doesn't get displayed
  until you switch to another source and back.
• disable shuffle, sorting
• freezes until new songs loaded/a song plays when done w/
  a song and the next song (or 2 or 3) fail to load (gst issue)
• fails to write/read keyring on Fedora 8 and Achlinux
• on quit if last source was a last.fm station, switches to
  Library before exiting which is slow.

Features:
• love/hate buttons in mini-mode
• grab cover art as soon as we get a playlist [expected to be fixed for us in trunk]
• obscure/popular slider for recommendation stations
• support songs w/ free download URL
• discovery mode (subscribers only? only plays new music)
• combined stations - mix of several other stations
• event info (part of recommendations plugin? requires login to get personalized data)

This is a tiny C-based CGI proxy that accomplishes a few things. When a user
accesses the Amazon MP3 Store through Banshee, the initial home request and
any integrated search queries are sent through this proxy.

The following is accomplished by the proxy:

  - Use libGeoIP to quickly look up the country associated by the user's
    IP address; if the user is in a country with a dedicated Amazon MP3
    store, the user is sent automatically to that store; otherwise, the
    user is sent to the .com (US) store.

  - Set the Amazon Affiliate ID on the requests - the Affiliate ID is
    'banshee-20' and this ID is controlled/owned by the GNOME Foundation,
    a not-for-profit organization. 100% of all affiliate revenue generated
    by Banshee/this proxy is sent to the GNOME Foundation.

  - Generally provides a level of indirection over directly accessing any
    of the Amazon web sites explicitly in the client.

The default implementation of this proxy is currently hosted by the Banshee
Project at:

  http://integrated-services.banshee.fm/amz/redirect.do

If a distribution or other entity has a desire to modify the source code
of the Banshee client to access a proxy (this one or an alternate
implementation) hosted elsewhere, we request that the functionality and the
Affiliate ID 'banshee-20' be retained. Again, all generated revenue is sent
directly to the GNOME Foundation, which directly helps foster development
and awareness of Free/Open Source Software and surrounding communities.

Contributions to this proxy can be made directly against Banshee git, just
like normal. Checked in code will be pushed to the server above. The redirect.c

Thank you for supporting the GNOME Foundation!

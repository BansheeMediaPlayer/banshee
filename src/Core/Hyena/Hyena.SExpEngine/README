Version 0.1
-----------

SExpEngine provides an advanced S-Expression parser and tree 
evaluator with a number of implemented functions. It supports full
conditional support, loops, lists, numbers, and strings. Functions
can be defined in side an S-Expression or installed as runtime 
hooks. 

It aims to provide LISP-like scripting support for .NET applications. While
the syntax is very similar to LISP, it is not a real LISP implementation,
nor does it aim to be. However, many LISP snippets can run unmodified by
SExpEngine due to its similarities with LISP.

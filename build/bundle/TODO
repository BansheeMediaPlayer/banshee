* Fix bug overlaying the skeleton on the bundle
* Generate Info.plist (rather parts of it)
  - version
  - copyright
  - file associations
* Add DMG support
* Figure out why solitary trashes the build root
* Figure out why there are still references to the build root
  - if the build root is removed, the relocated bundle works flawlessly
  - if the root exists, two copies of some libraries are loaded into
    memory with conflicting symbols, and we crash

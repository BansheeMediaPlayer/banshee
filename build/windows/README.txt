== Building

See http://banshee.fm/download/development/#windows for instructions for building Banshee on Windows.

== Creating the Banshee.msi installer

You need
- WIX 3.5
- GStreamer and GStreamer# (DotNet bindings)
- Gtk#
- Banshee built

With that, you should be able to run build-installer.js and have it produce the installer.

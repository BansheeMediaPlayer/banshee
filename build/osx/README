Building Banshee on Mac OS X 10.5
=================================

Dependency Frameworks
---------------------

  Before building Banshee, you must first install a few dependency 
  frameworks, namely Mono, Xcode, and a few small bootstrap libraries
  from the MacPorts project.

  When installing these frameworks, it is highly recommended that you
  leave all installation paths to their defaults.

  Install the frameworks in this order:

    * Xcode    (http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html)
    * Mono 2.0 (http://mono-project.com/Downloads)
    * MacPorts (http://macports.org/install.php)


Working Environment
-------------------

  Ensure that whenever you will be working with MacPorts (i.e.
  the 'port' command) or building Banshee or any of its dependencies
  that you have the /opt/local/bin path set in your PATH. It MUST
  come before Mono's framework!

  It is recommended that as a precaution you add this line to your
  ~/.bash_profile

    export PATH="/opt/local/bin:$PATH"

  Additionally, there are two helper scripts for actually building
  Banshee and any native libraries that will be bundled with it. 
  These scripts will be covered later.


MacPorts Dependencies
---------------------

  Install the gettext, intltool, glib2, and libtool ports from 
  MacPorts, in that order. This can be done like this:

    $ sudo port install gettext intltool glib2 libtool

  After this is done, you should not need to worry about the port
  command or dealing with MacPorts for building Banshee.


Banshee Bundle Dependencies
---------------------------

  A few libraries need to be built manually, outside of the MacPorts
  context. These are libraries that are bundled within Banshee.app
  to reduce the runtime dependencies that end users must deal with.

  Once your build environment is set up (as described in the three
  sections above), building these bundle dependencies is as easy
  as running the build-deps.sh script in this directory.


Building Banshee
----------------

  Once the build environment and the bundled dependencies are built,
  as described in the four sections above, building Banshee is as
  easy as running the autogen.osx.sh script in the top of the Banshee
  checkout.

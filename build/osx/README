Building Banshee on Mac OS X 10.5
=================================

Dependency Frameworks
---------------------

  Before building Banshee, you must first install the Mac OS X SDK (Xcode),
  and the Mono 2.0 framework.

  When installing these frameworks, it is highly recommended that you
  leave all installation paths to their defaults.

  Install the frameworks in this order:

    * Xcode    (http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html)
    * Mono 2.0 (http://mono-project.com/Downloads) 


Banshee Bundle Dependencies
---------------------------

  A few libraries need to be built that are not a part of either the
  Mac or Mono SDKs. These are libraries that are bundled within Banshee.app
  to reduce the runtime dependencies that end users must deal with.

  Building these bundle dependencies is as easy as running the build-deps.sh 
  script in this directory. It typically takes about 30 minutes to complete
  the full dependency build, but this only needs to be done once.


Building Banshee
----------------

  Once the bundled dependencies are built, as described above, building 
  Banshee is as easy as running the autogen.osx.sh script in the top of 
  the Banshee checkout, then running `make`.


Running Banshee
---------------

  Run the make-app-bundle.sh script in this directory once Banshee is built.
  This will result in a Banshee.zip file, inside is a Banshee.app folder that
  is a mostly standalone application - the only runtime dependency is the
  Mono 2.0 runtime.

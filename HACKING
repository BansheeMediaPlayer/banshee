C# Style Guidelines
===================

  1. Private variable/field names should be written like:

      lower_case_with_under_scores

  2. Property names, public variables, and functions should be written like:

      UpperCaseStartingLetter

  3. No spaces before function/conditional parenthesis, braces:

      if(condition) {
         CallSomeFunction(args);
      }

  4. One space before a brace on the same line as a conditional or property:

      while(condition) {
         ...
      }

  5. Namespace, Class, Method braces on separate lines:

      namespace Foo
      {
          public class Bar
          {
              private void Method()
              {
                  if(condition) {
                      ..
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  6. The exception to rule 5 is for Properties. The brace in the same line:

      public string Something {
          get {
             return "yay";
          }
      }

   6. Use 4 space characters for indention, NOT tabs
   
   7. Try to observe a 100 character wrap margin. If your lines are over 100 characters, break and
      indent them logically.

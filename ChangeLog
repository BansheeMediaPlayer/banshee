    mimetype checking instead of old Core DB.

  * DecoderRegistry.cs: Wrote DecoderRegistry class. This handles the parsing
    of the GStreamer plugins registry to build a local decoders registry
    for mimetype checking. The decoder registry is saved to XML for quick 
    loading on next run. Also will allow a UI for users to add/remove
    mimetypes.

  * PlayerInterface.cs: Using new FileChooserDialog instead of old FileSelector

  * PlaylistView.cs: Now all playlist additions are done based on a queue
    and an interface timeout. This reduces load time by over 250% (vs. a 
    1:1 loader/UI sync). Uses FileLoader/FileLoaderManager.

  * FileLoader.cs: Wrote a managed file/SQL loader. Manages a queue of
    load requests, allows the cancellation of all requests. FileLoader
    objects recurse directories and load TrackInfo objects, or load
    them from the database.

2005-03-01 Aaron Bockover <aaron@aaronbock.net>

  * PlaylistRowRenderer.cs: Removed extern constructors... not allowed in 
    latest mcs.

  * SourceView.cs: Removed extern constructors... not allowed in latest mcs.

    egg-tray support and mm-keys support. Dropped egg-sharp.dll.

    for the egg-sharp.dll assembly.

    database that are independent of eachother).

  * Data/Makefile.am: Included Tables.sql

  * Tables.sql: Defined all SQL Table construction in a SQL file, included
    as resource.

  * TrackProperties.cs: Updated to reflect new supported metadata. Also only
    shows fields that we have data for (instead of showing "Unknown Field").

  * TrackInfo.cs: Updated to reflect updated GstMetadata.

  * GstMetadata.cs: Updated GStreamer metadata backend. Using a Hashtable to
    store tag data. 
    
  * CommonTags.cs: Simple class containing GStreamer tag names as constant
    members.

  * AboutBox.cs: Updated about box with new graphic, a tabbed information
    layout, project information, and assembly information. New graphic does
    not reference version, and version information is written based on the
    main assembly, so no updates need to be made to this code anymore.

2005-02-21 Aaron Bockover <aaron@aaronbock.net>

  * Database.cs: Added dynamic mime type support checking based on
    a GstDecoders and MimeSynonyms table in the SQL database.
    If GstDecoders is empty or non-existant, it is constructed
    based on the GStreamer registry.xml file. No hard-coded supported
    mime types exist now.

    it can be toggled via J or F3 (Similar to Firefox, live searching)
